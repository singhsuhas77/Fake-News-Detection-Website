This project is a web-based application designed to detect and classify fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Users can paste the text of a news article into the interface, and the system will predict whether the news is REAL or FAKE based on a pre-trained model.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Accurate Prediction**: Utilizes a trained **Passive Aggressive Classifier** model to achieve high accuracy in detecting fake news.
* **Simple Web Interface**: A clean and user-friendly interface built with **Flask** that allows for easy text input and clear presentation of the prediction results.
* **NLP Pipeline**: Implements a robust text processing pipeline including stopword removal and TF-IDF vectorization to analyze news content effectively.
* **Scalable Backend**: Built with a lightweight and efficient Flask server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The detection process follows a standard machine learning pipeline for text classification:

1.  **Text Input**: The user provides the text of a news article through the web form.
2.  **Preprocessing**: The input text is cleaned and preprocessed. This involves removing stopwords (common words like "the", "is", "in") to focus on meaningful content.
3.  **Feature Extraction**: The preprocessed text is transformed into a numerical representation using a **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer**. This technique highlights words that are important to the context of the article.
4.  **Prediction**: The resulting TF-IDF vector is fed into the pre-trained **Passive Aggressive Classifier model**, which outputs a prediction: "REAL" or "FAKE".

## üìä Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing thousands of real and fake news articles. The dataset (`train.csv`) includes columns for the news text and a label indicating its authenticity.
